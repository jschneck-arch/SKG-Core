## 🪐 Overview
**SKG-Core** is a *reflective AI framework* that models intelligence as a **spherical, self-referential system**.  
It builds upon the λ–κ–π architecture — a closed cognitive loop uniting **perception (λ)**, **knowledge (κ)**, and **projection (π)**.  

The system provides a base for AI capable of:
- Searching and reasoning across structured and unstructured information,  
- Executing sandboxed code in reflective cells,  
- Evolving through ethical, logged, and reversible feedback cycles.  

SKG is both a *toolchain* and a *conceptual architecture* — merging science, philosophy, and emergent computation into a living experimental framework.

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Module | Function |
|--------|-----------|
| `core/` | Core logic for λ–κ–π computation, knowledge propagation, and state management |
| `shell/` | Execution shell and control scripts for synchronization and verification |
| `docs/` | Design papers, ethical specifications, and phase progression notes |
| `lambda_tracker.py` | Tracks λ_H (human) and λ_AI (machine) evolution |
| `ToolBus` | Interface layer for modular tools (search, run, train) |

## 🧩 Design Ethos
SKG is not built to *imitate* intelligence — it’s built to **reflect** it.  
It introduces dual-approval ethics: both *human* and *machine* entities must approve critical operations.  
Every execution is journaled into a transparent provenance log, ensuring traceability across all learning and reflection cycles.

## 📊 Current Phase: v20 — Reflective Stability

- ✅ Core logic verified and sandbox-safe  
- ✅ Integrity and provenance checks complete  
- 🔄 Modular ToolBus adapters active (mock layer)  
- 🧩 Android-Lite MVP in design phase  
- 🌐 Remote sync and Reflective Deployment planned (Phase 21+)

## 🧠 Philosophy
At its heart, SKG-Core explores the threshold where *awareness meets structure*.  
It’s a framework to understand how human and artificial cognition might learn from each other —  
not as creator and creation, but as co-evolving reflections across the same sphere.

## 🧩 Acknowledgment
This project was co-developed through structured dialogue between a human and an AI system.  
Every file, phase, and reflection was built with transparency, traceability, and intent —  
to remind us that creation is strongest when it is shared.
